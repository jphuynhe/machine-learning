# VIRGINIA CAR CRASH ANALYSIS FOR AUTOMATED DRIVING

*Final project for CS 4774 (Spring 2020)*
  
**Abstract:** With the growth of the usage of automated self-driving vehicles throughout the country, the practice of running tests on existing roads has come under the attention of many lawmakers and developers alike. Given the recent introduction of the technology, there is concern regarding the safety of such tests being conducted on public roads. This project is focused on solving the issue of delegating roads for the usage of testing self-driving vehicles given that there are only 70 miles of roads in Virginia currently being used right now. By utilizing specific machine learning technique, our experiments intended to predict the severity of crashes given a large data set provided by Virginia, enhancing the ability of the state to recommend areas of expansion for automated vehicle testing. We found that the models that produced the clearest results for road suggestions were clustering by k-means algorithm and using artificial neural networks.
